    "# Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've talked about several types of \"collections\" in Python, data structures that contain other data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings (which contain characters)\n",
    "- Lists (the main container, which contain anything -- traditionally many items of the same type)\n",
    "- Tuples (contains, traditionally containing different types)\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, we store and retrieve via the index, which starts at 0 and goes up to the length - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two problems: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we want to search for something, it can take a long time to find it, because we need to iterate over the entire data structure in order to search. The longer the string/list/tuple, the longer it can take to find out if a value is there.\n",
    "2. Storing and retrieving by numeric index is not very intuitive.  We might want to store/retrieve information about employees by their ID number. Or about cars by their license plates. We *can* use the indexes, but something else might be nicer/better/easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where dicts come in. Python is not the only language with dictionaries!  In other languages, we call them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hash tables\n",
    "- Hashes\n",
    "- Hash maps\n",
    "- Maps\n",
    "- Name-value pairs\n",
    "- Key-value pairs\n",
    "- Associative arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we are going to store not individual values, but *pairs* of values. One is called the \"key\" (it's the equivalent to an index) and the other is the \"value.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "We can only work with pairs, never just a key or just a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some rules for dicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every key has a value, and every value has a key.\n",
    "- Values can be *ANYTHING* at all in the Python world.\n",
    "- Keys are more restricted: They must be immutable (basically: numbers, strings, tuples), and they cannot repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's most common for us to define a dict with strings as keys, and something else (integers, floats, other strings) as the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a dict in some ways as a list in which we get to control not only the value that's stored, but also the index (key) we use to store it."
